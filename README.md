# Random Thought Generator: PWA version

Since I was able to use a .json file to generate thoughts in the extension version of Random Thought Generator, I also decided to make a PWA version because the JSON way doesn't really require any database and is faster at sending data from the database so it makes it a better option to use while offline. Hope you like it! :)
